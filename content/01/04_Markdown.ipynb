    "- GitHub uses it when you open a repo in a website: [In this repo](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2021), I have text that is bolded, italics, and code. There are headers for sectioning. There is a lot more you can do with Markdown, but that will give you a taste.\n",
    "- When we work in Jupyter, we will write python code in files called python notebooks (`ipynb` files, for \"IPYthon NoteBooks\"). In these `ipynb` files, we can have python code interspersed with sections of markdown text. As a result, we can write code and analysis that is easy to follow and execute. In other words, `ipynb` files are useful to create code that is [reproducible, reusable, and shareable[(../about/objectives).\n",
