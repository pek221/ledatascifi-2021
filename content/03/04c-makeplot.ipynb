    "1. Put your data into a DataFrame\n",
    "2. Format the data [long](02b_pandasVocab.html#the-shape-of-data) if you want to use a `sns` function\n",
    "3. Use `pd` or `sns` plotting functions.\n",
    "    - Q: Which? A: Which ever is easiest! `panda`'s plotting functions are simple and good for early stage and some simple graphics (bar, \"barh\", scatter, and density), but `seaborn` has many more built in options, has simpler syntax, and is easier to use, IMO.\n",
    "    - **Start with basic plots, then layer in features**\n",
    "    - Get the \"gist\" of the figure right\n",
    "4. If you need to customize the figure, you'll end up using `matplotlib` commands after the main plot function. Matplotlib is a full-powered (but confusing as heck) graphing package. In fact, both `pandas` and `seaborn` are just using `matplotlib`, but they hide the gory details for us. Thanks, `seaborn`!\n",
    "    - [This page](04f-betterplots) discusses customizing and improving figures\n",
    "    - **Only customize when necessary for hyper control. Focus on CONTENT** over hyper-control of formatting. \n",
    "    - Some \"format\" tweaks (add a title, change the axis titles) and choices about plotting can be quick/cheap and have high value, and you should do these **right before you finish your project/assignment** and are about to post it officially. Otherwise, focus on content.\n"
